**HOW TO TEST THE CHANGES:**
We need to confirm the changes first, so try to make the work easy for testers, please:
 - Which commands to use? Which NPC to teleport to?
 - Do we need to enable debug flags on Cmake?
 - Do we need to look at the console? etc...
 - Other steps

***** IMPORTANT: *****
The people who are going to test PRs are not necessarily coders,
so they might have no idea about what the code changes can affect.
For this reason the developer should at least explain what aspects 
of the game can be affected by the changes, especially when doing 
C++ changes on generic parts of the code.
